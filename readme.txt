Project deliverables include:
1. A runnable standalone pattern recognition system: This is included in SystemCode folder. The user guide is "Food Diary user guide.pdf"

2. Dataset: The dataset training the Nutrition Info Extractor Model is in NutritionInfoExtractorModel folder >Packaged-Food-Model_Data > test.record/train.record files. The dataset training the Raw Food Classifier Model is in the RawFoodClassifier folder > fruits folder.

3. Final report: PRS_PM_FinalReport.pdf

4. Python/R/Java/â€¦ codes, model files, other supporting documents (if any): The model file that is used for the system is in SystemCode > vgg_model_ga.h5 and frozen_inference_graph_Final.pb. The python codes used to construct the respective models are in RawFoodClassifier folder > Hybrid classifier (fruit_vege).ipynb, and NutritionInfoExtractorModel folder > PM2_TFOD_API.ipynb

5. Final video presentation: FoodDiaryVideo_Final.mp4
